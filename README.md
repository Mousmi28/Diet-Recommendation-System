# Diet Recommendation System

This project is a Diet Recommendation System built using Streamlit, Scikit-Learn, and Google Gemini AI. The system predicts personalized diet recommendations based on user inputs such as age, gender, weight, height, disease type, severity, physical activity level, and other health-related parameters.

## Features

- Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a Random Forest Classifier trained on health-related data to predict diet recommendations.

- Google Gemini AI Integration: Provides diet suggestions using Google Generative AI (Gemini 1.5 Pro).

- Data Preprocessing: Uses Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding, and Standardization for efficient model training.

- Interactive Web UI: Built with Streamlit for a user-friendly interface.

- Model Persistence: Saves the trained model and scaler using Joblib for future use.
